# Fantasy Games Infrastructure Documentation

## Overview
This repository contains the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation for the Fantasy Games platform, supporting multiple customers with features like user authentication, game logic, leaderboards, and real-time updates.

## Architecture Components

### Core Services
- **VPC**: Isolated network infrastructure with public/private subnets
- **ALB**: Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- **ECS**: Container orchestration for application services
- **RDS**: Managed PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
- **Redis**: In-memory caching and real-time updates
- **S3**: Object storage for static assets
- **CloudFront**: CDN for content delivery
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and alerting
- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall for security

### Security Implementation
1. **Network Security**
   - VPC with private/public subnet separation
   - Security groups with principle of least privilege
   - VPC endpoints for AWS services
   - Bastion host for secure administrative access

2. **Data Security**
   - Encryption at rest using KMS
   - SSL/TLS encryption in transit
   - S3 bucket policies and encryption
   - RDS encryption and automated backups

3. **Access Control**
   - IAM roles and policies
   - SSM Parameter Store for secrets management
   - Security group rules for service communication

## Environment Management

### Development (dev/)
- Reduced capacity infrastructure
- Feature branch deployments
- Non-production data sets

### Production (prod/)
- High-availability configuration
- Auto-scaling groups
- Production-grade monitoring

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
- ECS service auto-scaling
- RDS read replicas
- Redis cluster mode
- ALB target groups

### Traffic Management
- CloudFront caching
- WAF rate limiting
- ALB path-based routing

## Monitoring and Alerting

### CloudWatch Metrics
- CPU/Memory utilization
- Request latency
- Error rates
- Database connections
- Cache hit rates

### Alarms
- Service health checks
- Resource utilization thresholds
- Error rate spikes
- Cost anomalies

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Automated RDS snapshots
- S3 versioning
- ECS task definitions
- Infrastructure state backups

### Recovery Procedures
1. Database Recovery
   - Point-in-time RDS restoration
   - Read replica promotion
2. Application Recovery
   - Blue-green deployments
   - Multi-AZ failover
3. Infrastructure Recovery
   - Terraform state recovery
   - Cross-region replication

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform >= 1.0.0
- AWS account with appropriate permissions

### Deployment Steps
1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. Plan deployment:
   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars
   ```

3. Apply changes:
   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars
   ```
